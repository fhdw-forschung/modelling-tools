# This workflow will upload a Python Package using Pycaret when a release is created

# procedure for automatic Publish run (.github/workflows/publish.yml):
# - make changes; commit
# - manually bump the version with Poetry; commit
# - merge into main
# - add git tag and push to remote
# - create a release based on the Tag

# procedure for manual run per trigger (not recommended, only in case previous failed):
# - make changes; commit
# - manually bump the version with Poetry; commit
# - merge into main
# - run the publish workflow

# TODO: add predefined workflow to streamline procedure
